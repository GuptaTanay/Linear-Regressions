# Linear-Regressions

Linear Regression is a <b>Supervised Machine Learning</b> algorithm.It has different types:
1. Simple Linear regression.
2. Multiple Linear regression.
3. Polynomial linear regression.


### Simple linear Regression

It is a simple linear regression in which we have only 1 independent and dependent feature.
It works on the equation:-

<b> y = mx + c </b>

Where, y = Output feature
       m = Slope of the line.
       c = intercept.
